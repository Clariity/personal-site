<HeadingTwo>What is DesignRant?</HeadingTwo>

<Paragraph>
  The <InlineLinkText href="https://designrant.app">DesignRant</InlineLinkText>
  Project was set up by my friend <InlineLinkText href="https://sld.codes">
    Sam
  </InlineLinkText> to create a website where anyone could rant about any poor UX
  they come across. The point was to allow short, sharp rants about topics where
  the authors should propose solutions to the problems they have identified.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Another great aspect of it was that it was open to everyone and advertisement
  free. DesignRant aims to help get authors and developers names out there and
  gives authors the ability to link to their own sites and social media. You can
  even buy the authors a coffee.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  In the first 24 hours after release, the site received over 1 thousand
  visitors from across the world.

<HeadingTwo>What did I do?</HeadingTwo>

<Paragraph>
  <InlineLinkText href="https://sld.codes">Sam</InlineLinkText> reached out to
  me and another friend
  <InlineLinkText href="https://yannispanagis.com/">Yannis</InlineLinkText>, asking
  us if we wanted to help with the project.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  I designed and built the stats page and aided with minor decisions and styling
  throughout the rest of the site. I also contributed to a sister site that is
  still in development.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>In total I have made 17 commits to this project.</Paragraph>

<HeadingTwo>What did I learn?</HeadingTwo>

<Paragraph>
  I was introduced to the Gatsby.js framework that the application was set up
  with. Whilst I don't have any additional practise using this framework yet on
  another project, it was a good experience for me to use another framework that
  I hadn't worked with before, and learn about what great things it can do.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  In addition to this, I was introduced to using a 12 column css grid layout as
  an easier way to make the site responsive in comparison to my previous method
  of using max and min-width media properties.
</Paragraph>

export default ({ children, projects }) => (
  <ProjectWrapper meta={meta} projects={projects}>
    {children}
  </ProjectWrapper>
);

export const getStaticProps = async () => staticProps(meta);
