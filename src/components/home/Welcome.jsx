        The site is a fun project for me to consistently work on and expand as I continue to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Parts of this site are dedicated to selling myself and showing off what I've made and
        accomplished.
      </p>
      <p>Other parts are just for fun and trying out new things.</p>
      <p>
        Have a good look around. If you find any issues or have any suggestions then please{" "}
